# Maze-Generator
A maze generator in p5.js using the depth-first-search-recursive-backtracker algorithm.

Some example results, respectively on a 10x10, 20x20 and 30x30 grid (sorry I could not make a GIF of it making):

Inspired by a video on the same algorithm by a YouTube channel called [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman). (Coding Challenge 10)

POSSIBLY COMING SOON: Maze solver?
